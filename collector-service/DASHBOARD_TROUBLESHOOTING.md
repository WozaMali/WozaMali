# Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Identified

Based on the error logs you provided, you're experiencing several dashboard-related problems:

1. **Image Loading Errors**: `chrome-error://chromewebdata/` errors with webp format
2. **Dashboard Route Issues**: 0 B responses and 2.31s+ loading times
3. **Missing Components**: Dashboard component was not properly implemented

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing Dashboard Component
- Created a complete `Dashboard.tsx` component in `src/components/`
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented all necessary dashboard features

### 2. Fixed Routing Issues
- Updated `pages/dashboard.tsx` to directly render Dashboard component
- Modified `pages/Index.tsx` to show Dashboard after authentication
- Eliminated redirect loops that were causing loading delays

### 3. Added Error Boundaries
- Created `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component to catch rendering errors
- Wrapped Dashboard with error boundary for graceful error handling
- Added user-friendly error messages and refresh functionality

### 4. Enhanced Next.js Configuration
- Updated `next.config.js` with proper image optimization
- Added webpack loaders for better image handling
- Configured experimental features for improved performance

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- Missing Dashboard component
- Routing loops and redirects
- Basic error handling
- Image optimization configuration

⚠️ **Remaining Issues to Check:**
- Database connectivity
- Authentication flow
- Image file availability
- Browser compatibility

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Dashboard
```bash
cd collector-service
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and check if:
- Login form appears correctly
- Dashboard loads after authentication
- No more chrome-error messages
- Faster loading times

### 2. Run Database Diagnostics
Execute the `dashboard-diagnostic.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor to check:
- Database connectivity
- Table existence
- User authentication status
- RLS policies

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:
- JavaScript errors
- Network request failures
- Image loading issues
- Authentication errors

### 4. Verify Image Files
Check if the image files referenced in the code exist:
- `/WozaMali-uploads/` directory
- Logo files (PNG, webp formats)
- Favicon and other assets

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Dashboard Still Loading Slowly
**Solution:** Check database connection and RLS policies

### Issue: Images Still Not Loading
**Solution:** Verify image file paths and Next.js image optimization

### Issue: Authentication Errors
**Solution:** Check Supabase configuration and environment variables

### Issue: Component Import Errors
**Solution:** Ensure all UI components are properly installed and imported

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SERVICE_TYPE=collector
```

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard now includes:
- Lazy loading for components
- Error boundaries for graceful failures
- Optimized image handling
- Reduced redirect loops

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Run the diagnostic SQL script
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Check Supabase dashboard for service status
