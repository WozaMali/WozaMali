   - Click the "Delete" button on any transaction
   - Confirm the soft delete action
   - Transaction is moved to `deleted_transactions` table

2. **View Deleted Transactions:**
   ```typescript
   const { data: deletedTransactions } = await getDeletedTransactions();
   ```

3. **Restore Deleted Transactions:**
   ```typescript
   const result = await restoreDeletedTransaction(deletedTransactionId);
   ```

### For Regular Users:
- **No changes** to user experience
- **Deleted transactions** are automatically hidden
- **All existing functionality** works as before

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### Database Changes Applied:
- âœ… `deleted_transactions` table created
- âœ… RPC functions implemented
- âœ… RLS policies updated
- âœ… Views created for super admin access
- âœ… Helper functions for frontend integration

### Frontend Changes Applied:
- âœ… `WozaMaliOffice/src/lib/soft-delete-service.ts` (new)
- âœ… `WozaMaliOffice/app/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx` (updated)
- âœ… `WozaMaliOffice/src/components/admin/PickupsPage.tsx` (updated)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Implementation**

1. Go to Office App â†’ Collections page
2. Find a transaction to delete
3. Click "Delete" button
4. Confirm the soft delete action
5. Transaction should disappear from the list
6. Check `deleted_transactions` table to see the moved record

### 2. **Test Data Hiding:**
1. Delete a transaction using soft delete
2. Check Main App - transaction should not be visible
3. Check Office App - transaction should not be visible
4. Only super admin can see it in deleted transactions

### 3. **Test Restore:**
1. Go to deleted transactions (super admin only)
2. Find the deleted transaction
3. Click restore
4. Transaction should reappear in Collections/Pickups

## ðŸ“Š **Database Verification**

To verify the implementation is working, run these queries in Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check if deleted_transactions table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_transactions;

-- Check if helper functions exist
SELECT public.is_collection_deleted('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');

-- Check if RPC functions exist
SELECT public.soft_delete_collection('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', 'test');
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Happens When You Delete**

1. **Data is moved** to `deleted_transactions` table (not permanently deleted)
2. **Original records** are removed from active tables
3. **RLS policies** automatically hide deleted records from all views
