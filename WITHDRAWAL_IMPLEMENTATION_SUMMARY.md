# Withdrawal Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented withdrawal functionality in the Main App that saves withdrawals and sends them to the Office App for processing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- **File**: `supabase_withdrawal_migration.sql`
- **Purpose**: Fixed the `withdrawal_requests` table schema to match the WithdrawalService expectations
- **Changes**:
  - Added individual fields: `bank_name`, `account_number`, `owner_name`, `account_type`, `branch_code`, `payout_method`
  - Added proper indexes for performance
  - Updated RLS policies for security
  - Supports both `bank_transfer` and `cash` payment methods

### 2. Main App Withdrawal Page
- **File**: `src/pages/WithdrawalPage.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Payment method selection (Bank Transfer or Cash)
  - Conditional form fields based on payment method
  - Bank Transfer: Full banking details required
  - Cash Payment: Only amount required
  - South African bank support with auto-filled branch codes
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Responsive UI with proper styling

### 3. Withdrawal Service
- **File**: `src/lib/withdrawalService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - API-based withdrawal creation (instead of direct Supabase calls)
  - Support for both payment methods
  - Balance validation
  - Minimum amount validation (R50)
  - Withdrawal history retrieval
  - Error handling and logging

### 4. API Endpoints
- **File**: `src/app/api/withdrawals/route.ts`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/withdrawals` - Create withdrawal request
  - `GET /api/withdrawals?userId=xxx` - Get user's withdrawals
- **Features**:
  - Server-side validation
  - Balance checking
  - Database transaction handling
  - Office App notification integration

### 5. Office App Communication
- **File**: `src/lib/withdrawalNotificationService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Webhook-based notifications to Office App
  - Real-time status updates
  - Fallback to Supabase realtime subscriptions
  - Error handling and retry logic

### 6. Office App Integration
- **Existing**: Office App already has withdrawal management functionality
- **Features**:
  - View all withdrawal requests
  - Approve/reject withdrawals
  - Update withdrawal status
  - Real-time notifications for new requests
  - Admin dashboard integration

## How It Works

### 1. User Creates Withdrawal (Main App)
1. User navigates to `/withdrawal` page
2. Selects payment method (Bank Transfer or Cash)
3. Fills in required details based on payment method
4. Submits withdrawal request

### 2. Withdrawal Processing (Main App)
1. Form validation ensures all required fields are filled
2. API endpoint validates user balance and minimum amount
3. Withdrawal request is saved to `withdrawal_requests` table
4. Wallet transaction record is created for tracking
5. Notification is sent to Office App

### 3. Office App Processing
1. Office App receives notification via webhook/realtime
2. New withdrawal appears in admin dashboard
3. Admin can view withdrawal details
4. Admin can approve/reject withdrawal
5. Status updates are sent back to Main App

### 4. Withdrawal Completion
1. When approved, wallet balance is deducted
2. Withdrawal transaction is recorded
3. User receives notification of status change
4. For bank transfers: Funds are sent to user's account
5. For cash: User can collect from designated location

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE withdrawal_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    bank_name TEXT,
    account_number TEXT,
    owner_name TEXT,
    account_type TEXT,
    branch_code TEXT,
    payout_method TEXT CHECK (payout_method IN ('bank_transfer', 'cash')),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'processing', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled')),
    admin_notes TEXT,
    processed_by TEXT,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    notes TEXT,
    external_withdrawal_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Payment Methods Supported

### Bank Transfer
- **Requirements**: Bank name, account number, account holder name, account type, branch code
- **Processing Time**: 2-3 business days
- **Validation**: Full banking details required

### Cash Payment
- **Requirements**: Only withdrawal amount

## Security Features

- **RLS Policies**: Users can only view their own withdrawals
- **Admin Access**: Office App has full access to all withdrawals
- **Balance Validation**: Prevents overdrafts
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **API Authentication**: Secure API endpoints

## Testing

- **File**: `test_withdrawal_integration.js`
- **Tests**: Database schema, withdrawal creation, retrieval, status updates
- **Coverage**: End-to-end withdrawal flow testing

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute `supabase_withdrawal_migration.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test Integration**: Run `node test_withdrawal_integration.js` to verify functionality
3. **Configure Office App**: Ensure Office App is running and can receive notifications
4. **Deploy**: Deploy changes to production environment
