-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATE OFFICE APP VIEWS FOR UNIFIED SCHEMA
-- ============================================================================
-- This script updates the WozaMaliOffice app database views to work with
-- the unified user_addresses table instead of the old address system

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: DROP OLD VIEWS
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing views that reference old address tables

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.member_addresses_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.member_addresses_with_pickups_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.office_member_addresses_view CASCADE;
