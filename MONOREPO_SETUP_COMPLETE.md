# - Collector UI on http://localhost:3002
```

### 2. Individual App Development
```bash
# Main app only
npm run dev --workspace=@wozamali/main

# Office UI only
npm run dev --workspace=@wozamali/office

# Collector UI only
npm run dev --workspace=@wozamali/collector
```

npm run build --workspace=@wozamali/office
```

## 🔄 Real-time Workflow Implemented

The system now supports the complete workflow you requested:

1. **Collector punches in kg/material** → Database triggers
2. **Office sees pending approval** → Real-time updates
