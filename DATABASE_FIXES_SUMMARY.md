# üîß Database Schema Fixes Summary

## üö® Issues Identified

Based on the console errors you're experiencing, there were several database schema issues:

### 1. **Missing `collection_date` Column**
- **Error**: `column collections.collection_date does not exist`
- **Cause**: The unified schema's `collections` table was missing the `collection_date` column
- **Impact**: Dashboard service couldn't filter collections by date

### 2. **Missing Foreign Key Relationships**
- **Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'collections' and 'users'`
- **Cause**: Foreign key constraints were not properly set up between tables
- **Impact**: Supabase couldn't establish proper table relationships for joins

### 3. **Missing `member` Role**
- **Error**: `Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object` for role 'member'
- **Cause**: The `member` role didn't exist in the `roles` table
- **Impact**: Dashboard couldn't count total customers/members

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Database Schema Fixes** (`fix-database-schema-issues.sql`)

```sql
-- Added missing collection_date column
ALTER TABLE public.collections 
ADD COLUMN collection_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE;

-- Added foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE public.collections 
ADD CONSTRAINT collections_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE public.collections 
ADD CONSTRAINT collections_collector_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (collector_id) REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Added missing member role
INSERT INTO public.roles (name, description, permissions) 
VALUES ('member', 'Regular users who can submit collection requests', 
        '{"can_submit_collections": true, "can_view_own_data": true}'::jsonb)
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;
```

### 2. **Dashboard Service Updates** (`collector-dashboard-service.ts`)

#### **Fixed Collection Date Query**
```typescript
// Before: Only used collection_date
.eq('collection_date', today)

// After: Fallback to created_at if collection_date is null
.or(`collection_date.eq.${today},and(collection_date.is.null,created_at.gte.${today})`)
```

#### **Fixed Role Query**
```typescript
// Before: Only used role UUID
.eq('role_id', (await this.getRoleId('member')))

// After: Handle both UUID and text role_id
.or(`role_id.eq.${memberRoleId},role_id.eq.member`)
```

#### **Fixed Foreign Key Reference**
```typescript
// Before: Wrong foreign key name
users!collections_resident_id_fkey(first_name, last_name, phone)

// After: Correct foreign key name
users!collections_user_id_fkey(full_name, phone)
```

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Run Database Schema Fix
1. Open your **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `fix-database-schema-issues.sql`
3. Execute the script
4. Verify the fixes were applied successfully

### Step 2: Restart Your Application
1. Stop your development server
2. Clear any cached data
3. Restart your application
4. Test the dashboard functionality

## üîç Verification Steps

After applying the fixes, you should see:

1. **No more `collection_date` errors** - Dashboard can filter by date
2. **No more foreign key relationship errors** - Proper table joins work
3. **No more role errors** - Member role is found and counted
4. **Dashboard loads successfully** - All stats and recent pickups display

## üìä Expected Results

Your dashboard should now display:
- ‚úÖ Today's pickups count
- ‚úÖ Total customers count
- ‚úÖ Collection rate percentage
- ‚úÖ Total weight collected
- ‚úÖ Recent pickups list
- ‚úÖ Township and customer data

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Notes

- The fixes are **backward compatible** - they won't break existing data
- The `collection_date` column defaults to `CURRENT_DATE` for new records
- Existing records will have their `collection_date` set to their `created_at` date
- The `member` role is now properly seeded in the database

## üÜò If Issues Persist

If you still encounter errors after applying these fixes:

1. **Check Supabase logs** for any remaining schema issues
2. **Verify RLS policies** are not blocking access
3. **Clear browser cache** and restart the application
4. **Check network tab** for any remaining API errors

The fixes address the core schema mismatches that were causing your console errors. Your application should now work properly with the unified database schema.
